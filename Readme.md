# How to measure the size of the text block


<p>This example illustrates how to use the <strong>BrickGraphics.MeasureString</strong> method to measure the size of the text block. There are three different methods in this example:</p><p>- <strong>MeasureString1</strong> calculates the dimensions of the rectangle to fit a string, then creates a VisualBrick containing the measured string, and displays it in a preview form.</p><p>- <strong>MeasureString2</strong> calculates the dimensions of the rectangle to fit the specified string with a limitation on the maximum width (75 measurement units), then creates a VisualBrick containing the measured string, and displays it in a preview form.</p><p>- <strong>MeasureString3</strong> calculates the dimensions of the rectangle to fit the specified string with a limitation on the maximum width (75 measurement units) using the specified string format, then creates a VisualBrick containing the measured string, and displays it in a preview form.</p>
